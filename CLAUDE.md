Guidance for Claude Code (and future human developers) working in this repository.

## Product scope

WUWF Tools Portal (`tools.wuwf.org`) is a shared access/administration layer for a small,
fixed set of internal WUWF tools — not a general-purpose newsroom platform. It provides:
authentication, invitation/approval-based access, role-based authorization, a tool
registry, a dashboard, and admin screens for user/tool management.

Each tool (Editorial Planning, Remote Interview, Shared Clip Library, Audience Listening)
is its own focused application area with its own schema. The portal's job ends at "Open
Tool" — do not build cross-tool abstractions, a plugin framework, or speculative
integrations. When in doubt, keep scope narrow.

## Current milestone: portal foundation + Editorial Planning

This repo implements the portal foundation (app shell, auth, profiles, platform roles,
tool registry, dashboard, admin, RLS) plus the first real tool: **Editorial Planning**
(pitch backlog, configurable submission form and rubric, weekly meetings with
independent scoring, ranked agendas, and recorded decisions). Its design rationale
lives in `docs/editorial-planning-design.md` — read it before changing editorial
workflow or schema. **Do not build the Remote Interview media pipeline, Clip Library,
or Audience Listening tool** without an explicit instruction to start that phase —
those are separate milestones with their own schemas under their own route groups.

## Architecture

- **Modular monolith.** One Next.js app, one repository. Route groups
  (`src/app/(auth)`, `src/app/(portal)`) separate concerns; individual tools get their own
  route segment and, eventually, their own schema/migrations — not a separate service.
- **Supabase is the backend.** Postgres + Auth + (later) Storage. No custom API layer —
  Server Components/Server Actions talk to Supabase directly.
- **Row Level Security is not optional.** Every table has RLS enabled and is the real
  enforcement boundary, not a convenience layer behind app-level checks. See
  `supabase/migrations/20260722120001_rls_policies.sql`. The predicates those policies
  call (`private.is_administrator`, `private.ep_*`) live in the `private` schema so they
  are not reachable as REST endpoints — see "Authorization expectations".
- **Two Supabase clients, used deliberately:**
  - `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — publishable key + the signed-in user's session. RLS
    applies. Use this for essentially everything.
  - `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` — secret key, bypasses RLS. `import "server-only"`
    guards it. Use it **only** for `auth.admin.*` calls (inviting users) — nothing else.
    Never import it into a Client Component.
- **Authorization is centralized.** `src/lib/auth/authz.ts` (`requireActiveProfile`,
  `requireAdministrator`, `assertAdministrator`, `hasToolAccess`) is the only place
  platform-role/account-status checks should be written. Don't re-implement these checks
  inline in a page or action.
- **Privileged writes are server-only and audited.** Every admin action (invite, disable,
  grant/revoke tool access, edit the tool registry) is a Server Action that calls
  `logAuditEvent()` (`src/lib/audit.ts`) after it succeeds. If you add a new privileged
  action, log it the same way.

## Directory conventions

```
src/app/(auth)/            sign-in, request-access, /auth/callback — public routes
src/app/(portal)/          everything behind requireActiveProfile() (portal shell + nav)
src/app/(portal)/admin/    everything behind requireAdministrator()
src/app/(portal)/editorial/  the Editorial Planning tool (backlog, meetings, settings),
                           gated by requireEditorialAccess() from lib/editorial/access.ts
src/app/(portal)/tools/[slug]/   generic "coming soon" placeholder driven by the tools table
src/components/ui/         small shared primitives (Button, Badge, Input/Select/Textarea, Card,
                           Alert, Table) — keep generic; use these rather than re-typing
                           control/table class strings inline
src/components/            portal-specific components (nav, tool card, etc.)
src/components/editorial/  Editorial Planning display components
src/lib/supabase/          the two Supabase client factories — see above
src/lib/auth/              session lookup + authorization checks
src/lib/editorial/         Editorial Planning logic: access gates (server-only), data reads
                           (data.ts), the action failure helper (action-result.ts), plus pure,
                           tested modules (roles, scoring, staleness, form validation)
src/lib/*.test.ts          pure-logic unit tests, colocated with the module they test
supabase/migrations/       schema + RLS + functions, source of truth, never edit in place
supabase/seed.sql          local/preview-only sample data — never run against production
```

A future tool follows the Editorial Planning pattern: its own route segment, its own
migration(s) for tool-specific tables (prefixed, e.g. `ep_`), and it reuses
`tool_access`/`profiles` for authorization — it should not need portal-schema changes
beyond narrowly-scoped additive RLS policies like the ones at the end of the editorial
migration.

## Common commands

`npm run dev` · `npm run build` · `npm run lint` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm test` ·
`npm run format` · `npm run db:types`. Run lint, typecheck, and test before considering a
change done.

## Database workflow

New migration file per schema change (`supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>.sql`),
never edit a migration that's already been applied. Include RLS policies for any new
table in the same or an immediately-following migration — a table without RLS enabled is
a bug, not an oversight to fix later. Regenerate `src/lib/database.types.ts` after schema
changes (`npm run db:types` against a local instance, or hand-update it consistently with
the migration if no local instance is running — see the note at the top of that file).

## Authorization expectations

- New pages: gate with `requireActiveProfile()` or `requireAdministrator()` from
  `lib/auth/authz.ts`, not a hand-rolled check.
- New Server Actions: call `assertAdministrator()` (or the relevant check) as the first
  line, before touching any data.
- New tables: RLS enabled, policies scoped to `auth.uid()` /
  `private.is_administrator(auth.uid())` — follow the existing pattern in
  `20260722120001_rls_policies.sql` rather than inventing a new one.
- Authorization helper functions live in the `private` schema, never `public`. They are
  `security definer` (they read `profiles`/`tool_access` past RLS) and must stay
  `execute`-able by `authenticated`, because a policy expression runs as the querying
  user — revoking that permission makes every policy calling it fail outright. `private`
  is not in PostgREST's exposed schemas, so placement, not permission, is what keeps them
  off the API. See `20260724120000_private_authz_functions.sql`.
- Tool-specific roles (e.g. "Editor" for Editorial Planning) are free-text on
  `tool_access.tool_role` and interpreted by that tool alone — the portal does not
  understand or enforce them.

## Security requirements

- Never expose `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` to client code. It's only ever read inside
  `lib/supabase/admin.ts`.
- Never bypass RLS for convenience — if a query needs data RLS is blocking, that's a sign
  the policy is wrong or the check belongs in a Server Action, not a reason to reach for
  the admin client.
- Don't rely on hiding a button/link as the only access control — the RLS policy or
  server-side check is the actual boundary; UI hiding is a courtesy on top of it.
- Disabling a user sets `account_status = 'disabled'`; nothing about access ever deletes
  a `profiles` row.

## Testing expectations

Pure logic (authorization predicates, validation, state-derivation helpers like
`getToolCardState`) gets a colocated `*.test.ts` and should stay dependency-free enough to
run under Vitest without mocking Supabase. Don't add heavier test infrastructure
(Playwright, a test Supabase container, etc.) without a concrete need — that's a call to
make explicitly, not by default.

## Rules for making changes

- Inspect the relevant existing file(s) before editing; match existing patterns rather
  than introducing a new one for the same problem.
- Keep changes narrowly scoped to what was asked. Don't refactor unrelated code, rename
  things "while you're in there," or add abstractions for a single current use.
- Never discard a Supabase `error`. A read that falls back to `[]` and a write that
  redirects as though it succeeded both render exactly like a healthy screen, so a real
  outage looks like a UI bug — that is how an unapplied migration once passed for "the
  settings aren't configurable". Reads go through `unwrapRead()` (throws, caught by the
  route's `error.tsx`); writes go through `failIfError()` / `failWith()` from
  `lib/editorial/action-result.ts`, which bounce back with `?error=` for the screen to show.
- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/` are not self-applying. After adding one, apply it to
  the Supabase projects (preview first, then production) and confirm the tables exist —
  a migration that only lives in the repo ships a tool that silently does nothing.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm test` before calling a change done.
- Update this file and/or README.md when you change architecture, directory conventions,
  or the local/deploy workflow — not for routine feature work.
- Don't add a major dependency without a specific reason it's needed (and note that
  reason in the commit/PR description) — this project deliberately runs on a small
  dependency set.
- End each implementation task with a short summary of what changed and anything left
  unresolved.
